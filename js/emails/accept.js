Welcome to Hack Club! 

We loved your application and think you’ll run a great club at your school. 
There are just two more steps to complete before you’re officially *in*: 

1. [Join us on Slack!](https://hackclub.com/slack/) 
This is our community’s main communication platform and where you’ll get to
meet other club leaders and stay up-to-date on everything going on at Hack Club. 

2. Schedule a 30-minute onboarding call with us. 
These calls are a way to get to know each other and familiarize you with some 
tools to help run a great club. 
Please respond to this email with three weekday times that 
work for you in the next week or so and we’ll get that scheduled right away. 

Can’t wait to meet, talk soon!

Best,

Hack Club HQ
