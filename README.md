    The new Application Viewer!
</h1>

This is an admin tool used to view new club applications, then put them on either the naughty or the nice list. Ho ho ho!

The new application viewer is a redesign of the previous version. To get started with development:
1. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

2. Run the development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

> note: You'll need some environment variables which you can get by running `vercel pull`.

and tadaa! You're ready for development! Just go to http://localhost:3000/ with an Airtable record ID slug.
